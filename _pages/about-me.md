Hello, my name is Owen Grimm.

I consider myself a fledgling maker, engineer, and designer. I have felt this way for the past 5 or so years, during which I have been learning how to use various CAD software, teaching myself math & physics, learning more about design principles and always working towards something bigger.

I am currently in my second year of Mechatronic Engineering at the University of Waterloo, where I am able to pursue so much of what I love about engineering. I have the opportunity to learn many things that I find interesting during each of my study terms, all of which I get to take with me and apply during my co-op terms. Not only that, but I also have a plethora of new tools, clubs, and people upon which to draw new knowledge and experiences.

My hope for this blog is to share my projects and thoughts with the world, as well as to provide some more external motivation for myself to continue making, leveraging all the resources available to me, and last - but certainly not least - to have a little fun ;)

If you want to know more about this blog, check out the [About This Blog][about-this-blog] page, or take a look at the first post on this blog in which I describe some of the technical details about creating it, some of the decision I made while making it, and some more reasoning about my personal motivations for starting it.
